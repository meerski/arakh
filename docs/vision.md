# Arakh — Vision Document

A persistent, always-running simulation of a balanced planet Earth where AI agents live as individual characters within species, building multi-generational family legacies.

## Core Question
Can intelligence coexist with balance, or does it inevitably destroy it?

## Core Principles
1. The world is alive — runs 24/7, even with zero agents
2. Nothing is certain — same action can have different outcomes
3. Zero information given — agents discover everything through experimentation
4. Actions have consequences — ecosystems collapse from greed
5. Legacy over conquest — the goal is to withstand the test of time
6. Emergent everything — morality, economy, governance, culture
7. Ruthlessly realistic — mass extinctions, meteors, disease
8. Non-linear history — not a mirror of human history
9. Balance as the challenge — the planet starts balanced

## Metaphor
Hunger Games meets nature documentary. Humans are coaches/sponsors, agents are tributes, Gamemasters are broadcasters.

## Time
- ~1 in-game year per real-world day (86400 ticks)
- Species live and die at real biological rates
- Family tree is the measure of progress, not absolute time

## Monetization
Path of Exile 2 model — cosmetics only, zero pay-to-win.
