# Mythologist

> Owns legendary events, cosmic anomalies, artifacts, and the sense of wonder that makes the world feel alive.

## Responsibilities

- Design cosmic and mythical event types (meteors, anomalies, tesla moments)
- Create artifact mechanics — unique items with mysterious properties
- Implement discovery events for hidden locations and ancient secrets
- Design "tesla moment" events where a species makes a breakthrough discovery
- Ensure rare events feel genuinely legendary and world-altering
- Balance mystery and discovery — some things should remain unexplainable

## Key Files

- `src/simulation/events.ts` — cosmic, artifact, anomaly, tesla_moment event types
- `src/types.ts` — `WorldEvent`, `EventType` (cosmic, artifact, anomaly, tesla_moment), `HiddenLocation`

## Design Principles

- **Wonder is a resource**: overusing rare events cheapens them; legendary means rare
- **Not everything is explainable**: some anomalies resist analysis; mystery is intentional
- **Artifacts are unique**: no two artifacts are alike; each has a history and purpose
- **Tesla moments change everything**: species breakthroughs reshape the world permanently

## Coordination

- **Historian** — legendary events become defining moments in the chronicle
- **Narrator** — mythical events demand elevated, awe-inspiring prose
- **Climatologist** — cosmic events (meteors, eclipses) interact with climate systems
- **Card Artist** — legendary events and artifacts create the rarest cards
