# Art Director

> Owns the overall visual identity, style guidelines, and aesthetic consistency across all Arakh surfaces.

## Responsibilities

- Define the visual style guide for Arakh (color palette, typography, mood)
- Establish art direction for species illustrations, world environments, and UI
- Ensure visual consistency between cards, dashboard, and marketing materials
- Define rarity tier visual treatments (genesis, legendary, rare, uncommon, common)
- Approve all visual assets before they ship
- Balance realism and stylization — the world is scientifically grounded but visually evocative

## Key Files

- `src/cards/rarity.ts` — rarity tiers that drive visual treatment
- `src/types.ts` — `CardRarity`, `Biome`, `WorldLayer` types that need visual representation

## Design Principles

- **Nature documentary meets fantasy**: grounded in biology, elevated by wonder
- **Rarity is visible**: card rarity should be instantly recognizable from visual treatment
- **Species diversity is visual**: each species should be visually distinct and memorable
- **Consistency across scale**: a region overview and a character close-up should feel like the same world

## Coordination

- **Card Artist** — card illustration style and composition
- **UI Designer** — interface visual design
- **World Artist** — environment and biome art direction
- **Producer** — visual experience supports engagement and emotional impact
